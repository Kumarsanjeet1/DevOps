    Â°Earlier US Gov. Created a program that is "ARPA" (Advanced Research Projects Agency).
    Â°ARPA developed to "ARPANET" for communicate to each other accross the ARPA's centers.
    Â°They were 4 ARPA's center-
        â€¢MIT  â€¢Standford  â€¢UCLA  â€¢Utah
    Â°They were using protocol (TCP/IP) for communicate.
    Â°Afterwards, more & more computers also centers were added and still using protocal (TCP/IP) for communicate.

    Â°Many people wanted to share the research project & stuff, which was not really working in this domain.
         Actually things happend is that the I wanna send the research project Documentation from "Mit" to "Standford" and in the document there was some sort of other document which is interlinked with hyperlink. This was ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89514486/153749741-da2ed24b-f28a-4310-b1fa-cfe76e9bf97a.png) the things was we missed in it, we are not able to access the other some documentation, which is in hyperlink.
         Then Here comes "WWW".

   :-Protocols are basically rules that's are defined by "INTERNET SOCIETY".
        
     Example:- (Different types of data i am trying to send over the Internet, 
          So different types of rule will be required. They might be some rules set by someone.
          If you sending a secure file, the Internet should make sure that the 100% of data that you have sent will be delivered.)
          These rules are setup by Internet society  People, How a particular data is being send, is known as protocols.
          Examples of Protocols:- TCP/IP , UDP, e.t.c.
