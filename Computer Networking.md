    Â°Many people wanted to share the research project & stuff, which was not really working in thid domain.
         Actually things happend is that the I wanna send the research project Documentation from "Mit" to "Standford" and in the document there was some sort of other document which is interlinked with hyperlink. This was the things was we missed in it, we are not able to access the other some documentation, which is in hyperlink.
         Then Here comes "WWW".
